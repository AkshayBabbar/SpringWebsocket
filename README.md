## SpringWebsocket
This is a SpringWebSocket Demo POC for basic IRC Client Operations.

Technologies in place here are:
- SpringBoot
- SockJS
- Maven
- WebSocket
- STOMP


### Intent:

- The project intention was to get basic know how about websocket Client and how STOMP protocol works
- SpringBoot interation with SockJS with STOMP liasing the change here.
- Message Routing in STOMP via send and subscriber.
- When using STOMP over WebSocket/SockJS, if the STOMP client and server negotiate heartbeats to be exchanged, the SockJS heartbeats are disabled.
